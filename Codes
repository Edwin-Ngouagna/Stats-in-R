# The categories not seen for example Marital status - divorced are used as reference categories
# only Marital status- married and viral load > 40 are significant, Lets get the odds
#1 odds of being married and coming down with a parasitic infestation compared to being divorced
exp(0.0119)
# ans is 1.011971
# interpretation is there is no change in coming down with parasitic infection if your are married or divorced because the odds = 1

#2 odds of being having viral load <40 and coming down with a parasitic infestation compared to >40
exp(0.0270)
# ans is 1.027368
# interpretation is there is no change in coming down with a parasitic infection based on viral load of >or< 40 because the odds = 1,
# if the odds were 2, it will mean a 2 fold change i.e someone with viral load of <40 is twice as much to come down with a parasitic infection compared to someone with viral load >40 and vice versa if it were - 2.
